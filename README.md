Open hGrants Wordpress Plugin

The Open hGrant Plugin is a WordPress plugin that helps grantmakers publish and report grant data from any grants management system to both their websites and to machine-readable open data initiatives, such as the Foundation Center’s Reporting Commitment.

With the Open hGrant Plugin installed, WordPress  creates a new ‘grant’ post type that includes core information about each grant, and additional fields specified by the hGrant format supported by The Foundation Center, a leading source of information on philanthropy, fundraising, and grant programs. These posts can then be displayed on your site via a customizable, sortable, searchable index. They are also published to an independent hGrant-compatible feed. For a live example, see the grant listings on the WordPress site operated by plugin sponsor, The Walter & Elise Haas Fund. For a description of the hGrant specification, download this PDF.

Please note that the Open hGrant Plugin is designed to automatically report published grant data to the Foundation Center and, by default, to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI).
